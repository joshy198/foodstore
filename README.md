#DOCUMENTATION
We are currently using TravisCi, DockerHub and SonarQube

Some sources we used for setup:
[Setup SonarQube with angular](https://medium.com/@learning.bikash/angular-code-coverage-with-sonarqube-d2283442080b).
[Setup of Travis for Angular](https://medium.com/angular-in-depth/the-angular-devops-series-ct-ci-with-travis-ci-and-github-pages-3c02664f078).

We mainly used the informations from previous exercises and also decided to rely mostly on these tools, as we got some imput on how to use than as well as good integration for our anuglar project.
